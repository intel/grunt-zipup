The smallest app which counts as a valid Tizen app.

It provides a benchmark for measuring other apps against, as
it sets the lower limit on how fast a Tizen app can run: every other
app is going to be slower than this one, as it has nothing in it.

Note that it loads a single JS file, to provide some semblance of
realism.

Note that this isn't the full application and probably won't work
if you try to make it.
